<!-- Step 2:
- Create a quick, easy website that has a single button that says "Generate Doggo"
- Write a click listener on that button 
- Make the click listener change the text of the button to "Generating Doggo..."

Step 3:
- Inside your click listener, make a GET request using axios.get('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random'); 
- Confirm that a new AJAX request shows up in the Network tab of the developer tools everytime you click on the button

Step 4:
- Chain a .then(function(data) {}) off of axios.get(...) 
- Make sure your callback function takes a parameter called "data"
- Use the image url contained in "data" to render a dog image to the screen using DOM manipulation. (remember, you can create a new image with document.createElement('img'), and you can set the src attribute of the image with javascript)
- Make the button text go back to "Generate Doggo" after the image is appended to the screen -->
